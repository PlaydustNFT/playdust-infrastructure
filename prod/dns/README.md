# Terraform files for DNS (route53)

## These files map to the terraform cloud space, dns-prod

Some DNS entries may have been manually entered, just as resources may be defined in AWS accounts outside terraform. 
This is fine, and terraform will generally only modify resources it knows about, resources that it created, or that have been imported.

Other resources will not be touched.
